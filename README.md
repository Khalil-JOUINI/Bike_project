Creating Dashboard using excel
Hello! I'm eager to share a recent project I had the privilege of working on. 
My primary role involved overseeing the meticulous data cleaning process and crafting an automated dashboard in Excel. 
his dashboard became a powerful tool for dissecting and understanding the intricacies of bike sales. Through meticulous data cleaning, 
I ensured the accuracy and reliability of the dataset, laying a robust foundation for subsequent analysis.

The automated Excel dashboard proved instrumental in unraveling key insights from the sales data.
By employing dynamic visualization and analytical features, I was able to present a comprehensive overview of bike sales trends.
The dashboard not only streamlined the analysis process but also facilitated informed decision-making by providing stakeholders with a visually intuitive representation 
of critical sales metrics.
